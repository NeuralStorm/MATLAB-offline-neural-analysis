# recfield_main
## Steps in recfield_main
1. Select project directory with config, labels, and data
    * conf_recfield.csv
    * labels_subjID.csv
2. Format relative response matrix from neural data
3. Run receptive field analysis  
    * If cluster_analysis is true, run cluster analysis
4. Plot PSTH and receptive field measures and save to graph directory

# Running recfield_main  
1. Make sure data is organized in proper file structure. [See here for more details.](./file_layout.md)
2. Make sure filenames match [naming convention.](./filename_convention.md)
3. Make sure offline codebase is on your Matlab path. [Click here for details on adding dependencies](https://github.com/moxon-lab-codebase/docs/blob/main/matlab_basics/adding_dependencies.md).
4. Make sure you have these other dependencies as well:
    * [Curve Fitting Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/curvefitting.html): This allows for the smooth function to be called during significance check.
    * [Parallel Computing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html): This is used to help speed up plotting the PSTHS. This is not needed if you skip graphing
    * [Scrollsubplot](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7730-scrollsubplot): The scrollsubplot is required for plotting the PSTHs. This is not needed if you skip graphing.
5. [Make a labels file for each subject.](./labels_file.md)
    * labels_subjID.csv
6. Set up config file. See config section below for more details.
    * conf_recfield.csv
7. Run `recfield_main` in Matlab's command window and select path to project directory.

## Config
    * conf_recfield.csv

### Cluster Analysis Results
These metrics are calculated the same way as the receptive field metrics are, but applied to a "cluster" response. Each calculation is prefaced with which cluster it came from and there are three clusters reported: first, last, and primary cluster (example columns: first_duration, primary_duration, and last_duration for each cluster). The primary cluster is the cluster with the biggest response and used for the normalization calculations for the other clusters.
