# ica_main

## Summary

The `ica_main` function performs independent component analysis on feature sets stored in an MNTS file format. Once the target directory has been set up with the [required file structure](https://github.com/NeuralStorm/MATLAB-offline-neural-analysis/blob/kevin-docs/docs/file_layout.md), and filenames match the [required naming conventions](https://github.com/NeuralStorm/MATLAB-offline-neural-analysis/blob/kevin-docs/docs/filename_convention.md), make sure that MONA is in your Matlab path and run `pca_main` in the command window to start the program.

## Program Workflow

## Configuration File

The particular variables MONA will expect to find in `conf_pca.csv` are:

|Variable Name|Description| Format |
|:-----------:|:--:| :----------:|

## Output

|Variable Name| Description |
