    "# Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of the PSTH Receptive Field Analysis is (1) To determine if a response is significant, and (2) If the response is significant, identify the first, last, and peak latencies, the response magnitude, peak magnitude, and other measures of interest about the response."

    "# Significance Determination\n",
    "There are several ways to determine if a channel has a significant response to a given event type. Here, we will outline the parameters that can be used to determine if the channel had a significant response.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Channel psth is smoothed with a moving average filter\n",
    "  * user can set `span` to control smoothing\n",
    "  * if span < 3, no smoothing happens\n",
    "  * if span is even, matlab will do span - 1 to make it odd\n",
    "2. Determine threshold\n",
    "  * threshold = background firing rate + (threshold_scalar * std(background firing rate))\n",
    "  * user can set `threshold_scalar` to any scalar value\n",
    "3. Check to see if enough consecutive bins are above threshold\n",
    "  * user can set `consec_bins` to an int value of number of consecutive bins they want\n",
    "4. Statistical testing (if selected)\n",
    "  * check to see if baseline psth is statistically different from response psth\n",
    "  * user can set `sig_check`\n",
    "    * 0 = none, 1 = two sample t test, 2 = two sample ks test\n",
    "5. If significant, then find metrics\n",
    "  * if `mixed_smoothing` is true\n",
    "    * `span` >= 3, otherwise no smoothing will occur\n",
    "    * fbl, lbl, and duration will be found using the smoothed psth\n",
    "    * rm, corrected rm, peak, pbl, response window firing rate, and response window total spikes will be found based on the unsmoothed psth"
