How to run the GUI 

to import .plx files and merge as matnd files : 
chose the directory containing all the .plx files to be merged and analyzed. 
Select each file individually, select the stimulus to be merged ( 'Event002' in my case )
Set the exp label in each file ( Date.Animal.ExpType.Loc.) 
Hit Apply All
Select all the files to be merged using shift key
Hit merge files. 
Import files. 


If this doesn't work, you can import files first and then repeat the same procedure as above.
