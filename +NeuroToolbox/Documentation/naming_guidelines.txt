Naming classes, class properties, class methods, variables, functions,
function arguments, and function parameter names:

    If a multi-word name is used, it should be formatted in the following
    way:
        word1_word2_word3_etc
    Note: preferable to have fewer words. All characters should be
    lower-case. Only acronyms should be capitalized (e.g. PSTH, PEM, SDK,
    etc.)

    Applying this rule consistently will make using the toolbox easier,
    since inconsistent capitalizations and multi-word formats do not need
    to be memorized.

    Folders, code, etc. that come from an external source should NOT be
    rewritten to follow this rule. For example, the 'runica' function
    from the EEGLAB toolbox would be named 'run_ICA' in this format, but
    since it is from an external source, the original naming is used. To
    maintain ease of use, functions like this should be used internally
    by the toolbox, to avoid exposing inconsistent naming to the user.
