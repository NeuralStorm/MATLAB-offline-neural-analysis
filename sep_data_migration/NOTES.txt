The scripts in this folder are used to rename .rhs intan recordings to the proper format for the codebase 
(only for recordings made before the codebase file-tree revamp in early 2020). In order to prevent accidental destructive changes to file names, 
and to assign recording session IDs to recordings in the order in which they were recorded, a filename ‘lookup table’ is created using 
file_rename_lookup_table.m. This table links original filenames to the new, properly formatted filename. It does not do the actual file renaming. 
The output of this scrip should be exported to a excel file, and placed in the folder which contains the files to be renamed. 
Run batch_file_rename.m to rename files. This script compares the files in the folder, with the original filenames in the lookup table. 
If a filename is found, it renames the file to the associated properly formatted filename.
